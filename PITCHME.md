# How I review PR
---
# Do I understand the **WHY**?
What problem is the PR I am reviewing trying to solve?
+++
## I must be sure to understand the problem **before** diving into the solution
+++
## Understanding the problem, helps me by
- setting up the constraints
- forcing me to focus on **one** problem only
+++
## I do not look at the code after having understood the problem. If I don't understand it, then I will ask someone to explain it to me
+++
## How I do this?
1. Reading the PR documentation
2. Readng the related US/task/issue
3. If some of them are missing... **SHAME ON YOU!!!**
---
# Do I understand the **WHAT**
What solution does this PR (and the developers behind it) propose?
---
# Do I understand the **HOW**
Is the solution well or badly implemented?
